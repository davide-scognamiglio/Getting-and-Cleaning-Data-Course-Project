Main files included in zip archive:
README.txt
features_info.txt ->  info about var used in "features" file
features.txt -> list of all features
activity_labels.txt
train/X_train.txt -> training dataset
train/y_train.txt -> training labels
test/X_test.txt -> test set
test/y_test.txt -> test labels

This code:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
